# Tokens

Learn about the the different types of tokens available in Point Chain.

## Introduction

Point Chain is a Cosmos-based chain with full Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) support. Because of this architechture, tokens and assets in the network may come from different independent sources.

## The POINT Token

The denomination used for staking, governance and gas consumption on the EVM is POINT Token. POINT provides the utility of: 

* Securing the Proof-of-Stake chain.
* Used for governance proposals. 
* Distribution of fees to validator and users.
* As mean of gas for running smart contracts on the EVM.

Point Chain uses [Atto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atto-) POINT as the base denomination to maintain parity with Ethereum.

1 POINT = 10<sup>18</sup> aPOINT

This matches Ethereum denomination of:

1 ETH = 10<sup>18</sup> wei

## Cosmos Coins

Accounts can own Cosmos coins in their balance, which are used for operations with other Cosmos and transactions. Examples of these are using the coins for staking, IBC transfers, governance deposits and EVM.

## EVM Tokens

Point Chain is compatible with ERC20 tokens and other non-fungible token standards (EIP721, EIP1155)
that are natively supported by the EVM.
