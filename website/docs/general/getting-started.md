Welcome to the Point Network Wiki! This central source of truth contains guides for interacting with the
core functionality. 

:::note
Our wiki has five main sections.

* [Learn](learn-index) (for learners)
* [Build](build-index) (for people that want to build on Point Network)
* [Maintain](maintain-index) (for people that want to maintain the network)
* [Use](use-index) (for end users)
* [Point Chain](point_chain/about/overview) (for learning about the Point Chain Blockchain and Point Chain Validators)

## What is Point Network?

**Point Network** is an implementation of **decentralized internet**, also known as **web 3.0**. Learn how it is designed to **take control of your data** away from nation states and corporations and give it back to you.

## Say No to Mass Surveillance

Point Network is a step towards **curbing the efforts to spy** on every single computer user, including you and your loved ones, **secretly archiving** all your emails, photos, messages, search history, browser history, phone calls, private videoconferences, **storing them forever** in massive private data center facilities, and frequently **abusing this superpower** for personal, career and political interests.

## Say No to Censorship

Sometimes it’s visible, when "Big Tech" social media corporations **deplatform** a sitting president of the United States (although we’re politically neutral, it’s not hard to realize that **now they can shut down anyone**). Sometimes it’s hidden, as with the ability to single-handedly change the focus of public discourse by moving a slider to the left or to the right, and let their AI engine boost some voices and groups and suppress others.

## Fix Cybersecurity

The internet, initially, **wasn't designed** with security and privacy in mind. Decades later, we still **struggle to add security and privacy** as an afterthought. As evident from news every single week, it is so utterly broken, that the only way to get us out of this mess is to **completely redesign basic internet protocols**, drawing on the lessons of the legacy technology, but this time, **using the best principles** right from the start. It is certainly long overdue!

## Solution

**Tor, Bittorrent, Bitcoin, Ethereum** - all these projects were stepping stones on the way to the **Holy Grail** — **decentralized internet**, also known as **web 3.0**. Open for everyone, censorship-resistant, permissionless, privacy-oriented internet with programmable money built right in.

There are **many projects** growing in the spirit of this mission — from next gen social media to trading platforms, from office apps to games, from blockchains to streaming services.

**Point Network** is a proposed **holistic implementation** of the web3.0 vision. We're designing **main protocols** to serve as a **unifying infrastructure** for all such web 3.0 projects.
