### Run a Point Network Node in a VS Code Debugger

**NOTE**: You need to setup your local [dev environment](../build/build-zapp-dev-environment-direct-install.md) first.

To debug the Point Network node in VS code:

In your local pointnetowrk node folder, generate compiled typescript sourcemap files by running:

```
npm run build -- --sourcemap
```

This will create a `dist` directory including `*.js.map` files which are used by the VS Code debugger.

1. Open VS Code
1. Open the Debugger tool
1. Click `create a launch.json` file (located under the blue "Run and Debug" button)
1. Select 'Node JS' from the environment drop down
1. Replace the file created with the sample `launch.json` file shown below.
1. Make sure all the dependent dev services are running such as Arlocal and Ganache (as per the local [dev environment setup instructions](../build/build-zapp-dev-environment-direct-install.md))
1. Click the 'Play' icon next to 'Launch Program' dropdown on the top left
1. Open a 'Debug Console' tab in VS Code and you will see the running Point Node logs
1. Add a breakpoint to any part of the Point Node JS code (perhaps in one of the common handlers in the client proxy)
1. Open the Point Browser by running the alias `point-browser-owner`
1. Now you can inspect the variables in VS Code and use the debugger as usual.
1. Continue to add breakpoints where you need to assist with your build-debugging!

### Sample launch.json file

Below is a sample `launch.json` file that you can use. Its the same as the one generated by VS code with the `outputCapture` key added:

```
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "type": "pwa-node",
            "request": "launch",
            "name": "Launch Point Node",
            "skipFiles": [
                "<node_internals>/**"
            ],
            "program": "${workspaceFolder}/point",
            "outputCapture": "std",
            "env": {
                "NODE_CONFIG_ENV": "devlocal",
                "MODE": "zappdev"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```
